Usage: $program_name --hosts host_range [OPTIONS]... file_src1... file_dest

Options: (options can be presented in any order and can be abbreviated)
 --help, -h             Display this output.

 --version, -V          Display version and copyright information.

 --verbose, -v          Display verbose informations.

 --dry-run, -d          Only show what would have been transferred
                        without really distributing files.

 --checksum, -c         Update only files with changed content. Mostly
                        useful with -d to see which file will be altered
                        because it's often slower than default.

 --max, -m=NUM          Set the maximum number of concurrent copies
                        to NUM (default=32).

 --hosts, -n=HOST_LIST  List of target nodes. List can be separated by
                        comma, spaces or new line and can include
                        ranges or host groups
                        (e.g. "node001-node256 node300,Login,Storage").
                        Host groups must be defined by si_clusterconfig(8).
                        

 --hosts-file, -f=FILE  File that contains the list of the target host.
                        Every line can include one or more ranges or
                        host groups
                        (e.g. "node001-node256 node300,Login,Storage").
                        Host groups must be defined by si_clusterconfig(8).

 --timeout, -t=NUM      Set the timeout of the sessions (default=15s).

 --ssh-user, -l=USER    Copy the file as user USER on the target
                        machines.

=head1 NAME

si_pcp - SystemImager Parallel Copy

=head1 SYNOPSIS

si_pcp --hosts host_range [OPTIONS]... src1 src2 ... dest

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<si_pcp> concurrently copies files to multiple nodes via rsync.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8
 
=item B<--help | -h>

Display a short help.

=item B<--version | -V>

Display version and copyright information.

=item B<--verbose | -v>

Display verbose informations.

=item B<--dry-run | -d>

Only show what would have been transferred without really distributing files.

=item B<--checksum | -c>

Update only files with changed content (force checksum usage for all the
files on the sender). Receiver compares the checksums of each file (if
it exists and has the same size as the sender counterpart). Mostly
useful with -d to see which file will be altered because it's often slower
than default.

=item B<--max | -m NUM>

Set the maximum number of concurrent copies to NUM (default=32).

=item B<--hosts | -n HOST_LIST>

List of target nodes. List can be separated by comma, spaces or new line and can
include ranges or host groups (e.g. "node001-node256 node300,Login,Storage").
Host groups must be defined by si_clusterconfig(8).

=item B<--hosts-file | -f FILE>

File that contains the list of the target hosts. Every line can include one or
more ranges or host groups (e.g. "node001-node256 node300,Login,Storage").
Host groups must be defined by si_clusterconfig(8).

=item B<--timeout | -t NUM>

Set the timeout of the rsync sessions (default=15s).

=item B<--ssh-user | -l USER>

Copy the file as user USER on the target machines.
