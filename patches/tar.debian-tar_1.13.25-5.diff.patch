+The options -Z, --compress, and --uncompress all require that there be a
+'compress' utility installed on the system.  If there is no compress installed
+on your system, you will get errors if you try to use these options to tar.  
+
+Unfortunately, the algorithm used by compress is encumbered, and therefore 
+this utility is not part of Debian.
+
+The gunzip package can uncompress a file created with compress, but gzip can
+not create a file in 'compress' format.  Since the tar -Z option and friends
+end up calling 'compress' or 'compress -d', support for these options is not
+available in Debian.  However, at the time of this writing a package called 
+'ncompress' exists in non-free, and you can install it if the license terms 
+are acceptable to you.  
+
+Alternatively, if you don't really care what the format of the resulting file
+is, you could always create a 'compress' that is a symlink to gzip.  I refuse
+to do that in either the tar or gzip packages, however, since what gzip creates
+is a compressed file, but not a 'compress' format file...

+tar (1.13.22-1) unstable; urgency=medium
+
+  * new upstream version, released specifically to help close bugs in woody
+    upstream (Paul Eggert) says:
+      regarding 1.13.22
+        This fixes Debian bug 92106, in addition to the bug fixes I already
+        reported to you for GNU tar 1.13.20 and 1.13.21.  It also fixes a
+        core-dump bug for tar 1.13.19 and later, reported to bug-tar.
+      regarding 1.13.21
+        This fixes Debian bug 95984, in addition to the bug fixes I already
+        reported to you for 1.13.20.  It also upgrades tar to use gettext
+        0.10.39.
+      regarding 1.13.20
+        I haven't had time to fix all or even most of the bugs, but I suggest
+        closing out or modifying the following bug reports:
+        13312 I changed tar to avoid the problem (I hope; I can't test it).
+        52092 Fixed.
+        58890 Fixed, I think -- at least, I can't reproduce it now.
+        65719 Not a bug? last message in that bug report says it works for him.
+        77664 Not a bug.  In that context FOO:BAR means 'file BAR on host FOO'.
+        78179 Sorry, I don't follow this report.  Tar does strip leading '/'s 
+        	for me.
+        83458 Fixed.
+        83735 Fixed.
+        85400 Fixed for the info page only.  The man page is not part of 
+        	tar-1.13.20.
+        90794 This partly seems to be a Debian packaging problem; see 94257.
+        94287 Fixed.
+        95344 Fixed.
+        95984 Not fixed in 1.13.20, but will be fixed in next version.
+        99655 Fixed.
+        100883 This bug report applies to the Debian distribution only.

+Description: GNU tar
+ Tar is a program for packaging a set of files as a single archive in tar
+ format.  The function it performs is conceptually similar to cpio, and to
+ things like PKZIP in the DOS world.  It is heavily used by the Debian package
+ management system, and is useful for performing system backups and exchanging
+ sets of files with others.

+.Sh NAME
+.Nm rmt
+.Nd remote magtape protocol module
+.Sh SYNOPSIS
+.Nm rmt
+.Sh DESCRIPTION
+.Nm Rmt
+is a program used by tar, cpio, mt, and the remote dump and restore
+programs in manipulating a magnetic tape drive through an interprocess
+communication connection.
+.Nm Rmt
+is normally started up with an
+.Xr rexec 3
+or
+.Xr rcmd 3
+call or the
+.Xr rsh 1
+command.
+.Pp
+The 
+.Nm rmt
+program accepts requests specific to the manipulation of
+magnetic tapes, performs the commands, then responds with
+a status indication.  All responses are in
+.Tn ASCII
+and in
+one of two forms. 
+Successful commands have responses of:
+.Bd -filled -offset indent
+.Sm off
+.Sy A Ar number No \en
+.Sm on
+.Ed
+.Pp
+.Ar Number
+is an
+.Tn ASCII
+representation of a decimal number.
+Unsuccessful commands are responded to with:
+.Bd -filled -offset indent
+.Sm off
+.Xo Sy E Ar error-number
+.No \en Ar error-message
+.No \en
+.Xc
+.Sm on
+.Ed
+.Pp
+.Ar Error-number
+is one of the possible error
+numbers described in
+.Xr intro 2
+and
+.Ar error-message
+is the corresponding error string as printed
+from a call to
+.Xr perror 3 .
+The protocol is comprised of the
+following commands, which are sent as indicated - no spaces are supplied
+between the command and its arguments, or between its arguments, and
+.Ql \en
+indicates that a newline should be supplied:
+.Bl -tag -width Ds
+.Sm off
+.It Xo Sy \&O Ar device
+.No \en Ar mode No \en
+.Xc
+Open the specified 
+.Ar device
+using the indicated
+.Ar mode .
+.Ar Device
+is a full pathname and
+.Ar mode
+is an
+.Tn ASCII
+representation of a decimal
+number suitable for passing to
+.Xr open 2 .
+If a device had already been opened, it is
+closed before a new open is performed.
+.It Xo Sy C Ar device No \en
+.Xc
+Close the currently open device.  The
+.Ar device
+specified is ignored.
+.It Xo Sy L
+.Ar offset No \en
+.Ar whence No \en
+.Xc
+.Sm on
+Perform an
+.Xr lseek 2
+operation using the specified parameters.
+The response value is that returned from the
+.Xr lseek
+call.
+.Sm off
+.It Sy W Ar count No \en
+.Sm on
+Write data onto the open device.
+.Nm Rmt
+reads
+.Ar count
+bytes from the connection, aborting if
+a premature end-of-file is encountered.
+The response value is that returned from
+the
+.Xr write 2
+call.
+.Sm off
+.It Sy R Ar count No \en
+.Sm on
+Read
+.Ar count
+bytes of data from the open device.
+If
+.Ar count
+exceeds the size of the data buffer (10 kilobytes), it is
+truncated to the data buffer size.
+.Nm rmt
+then performs the requested 
+.Xr read 2
+and responds with 
+.Sm off
+.Sy A Ar count-read No \en
+.Sm on
+if the read was
+successful; otherwise an error in the
+standard format is returned.  If the read
+was successful, the data read is then sent.
+.Sm off
+.It Xo Sy I Ar operation
+.No \en Ar count No \en
+.Xc
+.Sm on
+Perform a
+.Dv MTIOCOP
+.Xr ioctl 2
+command using the specified parameters.
+The parameters are interpreted as the
+.Tn ASCII
+representations of the decimal values
+to place in the 
+.Ar mt_op
+and
+.Ar mt_count
+fields of the structure used in the
+.Xr ioctl
+call.  The return value is the
+.Ar count
+parameter when the operation is successful.
+.It Sy S
+Return the status of the open device, as
+obtained with a
+.Dv MTIOCGET
+.Xr ioctl
+call.  If the operation was successful,
+an ``ack'' is sent with the size of the
+status buffer, then the status buffer is
+sent (in binary).
+.El
+.Sm on
+.Pp
+Any other command causes 
+.Nm rmt
+to exit.
+.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
+All responses are of the form described above.

+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.LP
+This manual page documents the GNU version of
+.B tar
+, an archiving program designed to store and extract files from 
+an archive file known as a 
+.IR tarfile.
+A 
+.IR tarfile 
+may be made on a tape drive, however, it is also common
+to write a
+.IR tarfile
+to a normal file. 
+The first argument to 
+.B tar
+must be one of the options:
+.BR Acdrtux ,
+followed by any optional functions.
+The final arguments to 
+.B tar
+are the names of the files or directories which should be archived. The use
+of a directory name always implies that the subdirectories below should be
+included in the archive.
+.SH EXAMPLES
+.TP
+.B tar -xvvf foo.tar
+extract foo.tar
+.TP
+.B tar -xvvzf foo.tar.gz
+extract gzipped foo.tar.gz
+.TP

+.SH BUGS
+.LP
+The GNU folks, in general, abhor man pages, and create info documents instead.
+The maintainer of tar falls into this category.  This man page is neither
+complete, nor current, and was included in the Debian Linux packaging of tar
+entirely to reduce the frequency with which the lack of a man page gets
+reported as a bug in our defect tracking system.
+
+If you really want to understand tar, then you should run info and read the
+tar info pages, or use the info mode in emacs.
