#   This is a list of modules to exclude from the UYOK created initrd.img.
#   These exclusions can be overridden -- see the command you use to create
#   your UYOK initrd.img for details (Ie: si_prepareclient).
#   
#   Exlusions:
#   - must be listed one entry per line
#   - must use a relative path, starting from a base path of:
#       /lib/modules/`uname -r`/
#   - may be individual files (including module extension)
#   - may be entire directories, ending with "/*"
#
#
#   SystemImager standard exclusions go here:
#
build/*
source/*

#   Locally customized exclusions go here:
