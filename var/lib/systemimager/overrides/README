Q)  What's this override directory for?
A)  If you have used a modified disks-layout.xml file with the
    mkautoinstallscript command, then you may need to also modify your boot
    loader configuration file and/or your /etc/raidtab file (if you are using
    software RAID).  

    If you changed anything in the fsinfo section of the 
    disks-layout.xml, then you will most certainly want to copy the
    ./etc/systemimager/updateclient.local.exclude file from your image and add
    an entry to exclude the fstab file.
    
    If you are using more than one master autoinstall script for a particular
    image, it is recommended that you copy the original files into an override 
    directory, rather than modifying the files directly in the image.

Q)  Which override directory should I use?
A)  Use the one that is specified by your master autoinstall script.  By
    default, the override directory will have the same base name as it's
    associated master autoinstall script.  If you're still not sure, or if
    you're paranoid (good for you), then you can look for the OVERRIDES variable
    in your master autoinstall script to know for sure.

Q)  So I just drop the file in the directory?  How does SystemImager know where
    to put them on the client?
A)  SystemImager can't know where you want them to go on the client, so you must
    keep them in the appropriate directory heirarchy.

    For example, if you need to modify /etc/lilo.conf and /etc/raidtab, then
    when you're finished, an "ls -lR" from inside your override directory should
    look like this:

    imageserver:/var/lib/systemimager/overrides/foo# find
    .
    ./etc
    ./etc/lilo.conf
    ./etc/raidtab


Q)  Do permissions and ownership matter?
A)  Yes.  The permissions and ownership of directories and files in your
    override directory will be replicated on your autoinstall client.

Q)  But I want to use two override directories with a single autoinstall
    script!!!
A)  Ok.  Use as many as you like.  Just edit the OVERRIDES variable in the
    autoinstall script in question and include a space seperated list of the
    override directories you want to use in the order you want them applied.

    Example:  OVERRIDES="foo bar baz"

Q)  When do the override files get pulled over?
A)  They get pulled over:
    o after the main image is pulled over
    o prior to running System Configurator
