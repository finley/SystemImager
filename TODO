============= TODO for the dracut change before release is possible ===========
- update sbin/si_mkdhcpserver so it works with systemd (also sur service instead of running init.d script on old distros)
- fix si_prepareclient si it uses si_mkbootpackage instead of trying to build its own kernel and fail.
- fix si_getimage so it installs scripts in /var/lib/systemimager/scripts/main-install/
  fix si_getimage so it installs correctly remote boot package
  fix si_getimage so it moves <imagedir>/etc/systemimager/autoinstall_script.conf to disks layout.
- Add imaging a list of packages instead of a directory (protocol:bootstrap)
- Add network configuration using networkmanager (in a postinstall script at 1st)
- Add install of monitor_rebooted service in dracut module instead of postinstall script.
- Do not install grub on disk we did not handle

- FIXED: /root/rpmbuild/BUILD/systemimager-4.5.0/tmp/dracutbase/modules.d/51systemimager/module-setup.sh: line 38: cd: /usr/share/systemimager/boot/x86_64/standard/initrd_template/: No such file or directory => ERROR only occures if package is not installed on system.
- /run is not a virtual filesystem in old CentOS-6. Thus saving si_monitor.log there is useless. See if it can be achieved (in case of directboot)
- Add espeak log speak in case of warning or error.
- Distros to support: debian, ubuntu
- DONE: Distros supported: CentOS-6, CentOS-7, Fedora-27, OpenSuSE-42.3
- DONE: Add directboot feature.
- Check STAGING_DIR getarg. Seems not read anywhere.

- Update si_prepareclient and si_mkbootpackage doc. (-kver parameter)
- Fix si_mkbootpackage:
>>> Creating new initrd addind staging dir:  /tmp/.systemimager.0
tar: This does not look like a tar archive
tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors
- Fix si_mkbootpackage: avoid excluding empty driver dirs so dracut don't whine.

- DONE: OpenSuSE 42.3: Finish port to wickedd-dhcp4
  DONE:               have a look at http://manpag.es/leap421/5+wicked-config
  DONE:	              /etc/wicked/dhcp4.xml ?

- Fix build systemimager when it is not yet installed (/etc/systemimager/systemimager.conf missing
  => si_mkbootpackage fails
  SIS_CONFDIR=$RPM_BUILD_DIR/systemimager-4.5.0/etc dracutbasedir=$(pwd) perl -I ../../../sbin/si_mkbootpackage --dracut-opts="--local" --destination ../..
FATAL: parameter AUTOINSTALL_BOOT_DIR is not defined in /etc/systemimager/systemimager.conf

- Add support for querying password in plymouth theme to support SSH when no key is available.

- DONE: Add systemd unit files

- DONE: create /var/lib/systeimager/images-infos/
  move /var/lib/systeimager/configs into /var/lib/systeimager/images-infos/
  create /var/lib/systeimager/images-infos/scripts/{pre-install,main-install,post-install}
  move /var/lib/systeimager/scripts/*{sh,master} /var/lib/systeimager/images-infos/scripts/main-install
  move /var/lib/systeimager/images-infos/scripts/{pre,post}-install /var/lib/systeimager/images-infos/scripts/

  => dowload image-server:/var/lib/systemimager/images-infos/ to initramfs:/tmp/images-infos/ at early dracut stage (just when network is ok, in place of downloading configs)
  => DONE

- Partition are aligned to 1MiB so it fits all disks aligments.
  Enhancement: use http://people.redhat.com/msnitzer/docs/io-limits.txt if possible for optimal aligment.
               fallback to 1MiB aligment only if not supported/reported by disk.

- DONE: Enhance filename guess and make it concistant across all things we guess
  DONE: (IMAGENAME, SCRIPTNAME, SIS_CONFIG, DISK_LAYOUT)

- disks layouts:
	- DONE: <disk/part> Add missing @raid_dev in man autoinstallscript.conf
	- <raid> @rounding: what are the acceptable units? K for sure; any other?
	- DONE: <lvm> Add @lv_options to man autoinstallscript.conf
	- <disk> @recreate="no" Add this parameter to not whipe+recreate table if it is already present.
		=> If present but wrong type: error.
		=> If present and expected type: use it.
	- <part> @keep_existing="yes" If present, dont try to create it; size ignored. (needed to keep EFI partition)
	- <boot> new section for boot loader/ boot manager / wanted menus
- EFI support from scratch (be able to create the EFI partition and setup the EFI boot variables, kernel, and all that is needed to boot).

- DONE (using bash) CentOS-6 uses dash (not bash. dash=debian ash, in buzybox since v0.52) in dracut. dash doesn't support ${VAR/search/replace} or ${VAR:start:end} or $(command) syntaxes.

- OBSOLETE: need to fix mksiimage from systeminstaller that regenerate /etc/systemimager/rsyncd.conf with missing [configs] section.

- fix si_mkautoinstallscript => remove si_mkautoinstallscript

- DONE: update /var/lib/systemimager/ hyerarchy. try to move configs in scripts and try to rename script to a more suited name.

- network configuration.

- bittorrent protocol: use rtorrent or ctorrent, opentracker?, mktorrent, ...

- PARTIALY DONE: udpcast support

- EARLY STEPS DONE: deploy a docker image on a physical node

- EARLY STEPS DONE: NFS deployment method

- DONE: create systemimager-xmit-docker.sh install a docker image from a docker server if possible. 
   (cleaner to store image in docker container on a docker server than in an image server directory no?)

- update mksiimage ( add "--docker" switch )


#- rewrite si_mkbootpackage so it uses dracut.
#  Right now in order to build an initramfs package you need to issue the following command:
#  sudo dracut --force --add systemimager -no-hostonly --no-hostonly-cmdline --no-hostonly-i18n /path_to_image/image_name.img $(uname -r)
#
#  Example: to generate the systemimager-x86_64boot-standard-4.5.0-1.el7.noarch.rpm package content, you just have to issue the 2 commands:
#  sudo dracut --force \
#              --add systemimager \
#              --no-hostonly --no-hostonly-cmdline --no-hostonly-i18n \
#              /usr/share/systemimager/boot/x86_64/standard/initrd.img $(uname -r)
#  sudo cp /boot/vmlinuz-$(uname -r) /usr/share/systemimager/boot/x86_64/standard/kernel
#
#  Note: if you're using qemu to test, you need to add the 2 following options to dracut command:
#  --add qemu --add qemu-net
=> DONE. Fully working

- review all sbin/si_* commands.
  => For now, only si_mkautoinstallscript is working but needs major cleaning (including System.pm)
  => make sure that the $IMAGE_ROOT/etc/systemimager/etc/systemimager/autoinstallscript.conf doesn't contain any reference to system filesystems like (/proc, /dev, /dev/shm or so). Only filesystems that are not handled by systemd or udev like real filesystems, nfs mountpoints, ...

#- si_monitortk should work and handle the new status "shell". At the end of the imaging, aside reboot halt, shutdown, you can add shell so the system drops an emergency shell. Usefulle for debugging.
#  => Need to test the retrieving of logs from the nodes being imaged (can't test for now on a NAT VM)
=> DONE: Fully working

#- need to cleanup the loginfo, logwarn, logmsg functions in /lib/systemimager-lib.sh
=> DONE: Fully working

- need to comment /lib/autoinstall-lib.sh
- need to review and update all headers with authors and copyrights
- DONE: need to remove/cleanup useless stuffs in the source_tarball (kernel.rul and such).
- need to update deb packaging
- need to find a way to provide systemimager-x86_64boot-standard-4.5.0-1.el7.noarch.rpm without installing dracut-systemimager (does a dracut option allows to specify an alternative dracut directory))

# Need to check perl deps to SystemInstaller in si_* commands
perl(SystemConfig::Util::Cmd)
perl(SystemConfig::Boot)

============= TODO before use of dracut. Needs reviewing ======================
#- Handle this error:
#
#  ERROR: unsupported kernel 3.13.0-32-generic!
#  root@redmine:~/.ssh# 
=> OBSOLETE.

- create sbin/si_lsclient

    Concept: List names of clients and the images that they are targeted to
    install.

- find all systemconfigurator bits and update to postscript or other


#- When trying to complete the imaging, the SI master script needs to stop klogd
#  so that /sysroot/proc and /sysroot/ will umount cleanly (right now they get the device
#  busy msg)
#
#  - add entry to end of master script
=> OBSOLETE

- When it's time to update the bittorrent client/server:
    http://www.rahul.net/dholmes/ctorrent/ 

- DONE: Ideas on initrd
    - Use initrd on client system or server system as base
        - Let the distros muck about with the auto-detect details and what not
          -- they do a good job of that now
        - Augment distro initrd with SystemImager specific init scripts
        - Capture binaries from well known distros and package
            - Start with Ubuntu (what I'm running)
            - Simply modify existing make scripts
=> DONE.

    - Do build in a Docker container?  Provide container for anyone who wants to
      use it?
=> DONE.

    - Dracut or mkinitramfs or (rhel5 tool)
        - target as alternate location
    - Dracut has an option to include an overlay directory in the initrd:
        http://people.redhat.com/harald/dracut-rhel6.html
=> OBSOLETE. dracut was chosen for all dristros

Have a single init script.  Start services based on their settings in /etc/default/systemimager or /etc/systemimager/initscript.conf

Move _all_ source code into si.trunk/src

OBSOLETE: move _all_ *.rul files into make.d

OBSOLETE: Verify we have an "*_install" target for all initrd packages

OBSOLETE: Move ./initrd_dir/make.d/*.rul files into ./make.d/

DONE: Find some way to add color to logmsg, so that function names can be a different color from the output they produce...
=> DONE. (in text console AND in new plymouth based GUI.

mklibs.bef -- review output and re-direct -L towards locally built libs
mknods -- review this and see if we can remove now that we're using udev
=> OBSOLETE

Finley's new TODO list for SystemImager
---------------------------------------
DONE: (2) Support grub2 (and other improvements)

    * Thanks to Dennis Stam and Bas van der Vlies of SARA for their
      notes (below w/my modifications) to help me along here

        - Make sure init scripts for updated binaries come from the
          binaries' packages
        - xbusybox 1.16.1
        - xparted 2.2+ needed for grub 2 so we can set the grub2 partition
          flag
        - xudev 157. So we could remove the hotplug software.
          Autodetecting of hardware is better. 
        - yNo insmod and my_modules anymore?  I'm thinking we should keep
          this feature around in the mainstream SystemImager code for now.
        - kernel support with gpt labels needed for grub2 and upgrade to
          2.6.33.3 and switch to cpio for initrd instead of cramfs. The
          systemimager standard kernel use a lot of deprecated options.
        - changed bittorent client to aria2. Can handle more protocols:
           * http://aria2.sourceforge.net/ and is completely written in
             C++
        - all filesystem tools are upgrade to a newer version.
        - switched to udhcpc instead of dhclient. The former is included
          standard in busybox.
        - Further we completely removed the boel_binaries.tar.gz rsync
          setup.  Our modules and utilities are all included in the
          initrd.img. It is easier to upgrade to a new kernel.
        - /etc/init.d/functions. A lot is removed or has been rewritten.
        - the grub2 installations is handled in our post install script
          for now
=> OBSOLETE: handled by dracut

(3.5) Make sure built libs are used and included, and not libs from the
build system.  mklibs.bef invokations.
=> OBSOLETE: handled by dracut
OBSOLETE: (4) switch to udhcp

----

The prior TODO list for SystemImager
------------------------------------
(8) Introduce a new command (si_power) to control the power of the clients
    (turn on/off/reboot, etc.), see also: ipmitool, BMC.

(8) Create a new module called SystemImager::Monitor to implement all the common
    monitoring functions.

    Rename the monitoring commands as following:

    - si_monitord: SystemImager monitoring daemon
    - si_monitor: console interface (dump clients.xml info to stdout in a simple
      txt format)
    - si_monitorcurses: ncurses-based interface
    - si_monitortk: perl-Tk interface

(7) Include mkrecoveryISO in the standard release.

(5) Implement si_getdebuginfo to generate a tar.gz containing all the system
    informations that could help to debug user problems (systemimager versions,
    partitioning schema, kernel, distribution used, etc). In this way a user
    that needs support can simply post the tarball to the list and we'll have
    immediately an overview of the system.

(4) Move all LVM info into the <lvm> section of autoinstallscript.conf.

    - No longer store any lvm info in the <disk> and/or <raid> sections
    - Collect PV info and store it in the <lvm_group> section
        <lvm>
          <lvm_group>
            <pv device="/dev/sda1" />
            <pv device="/dev/md0"  />
            <pv device="/dev/md1"  />
            <lv name="swap" size="524288K" />
            <etc...>
          </lvm_group>
        </lvm>

    - Need to modify:
        - Server.pm
        - Common.pm
        - autoinstallscript.template

(4) si_monitortk improvements (thanks Bernard for the good suggestions):
    - support multiple virtual console instances at the same time
    - add a popup menu on the client entries to display detailed info
      and perform special actions (like open virtual console, check
      availability of the node, delete entry, etc)
    - tabbed view for virtual console

(4) Implement a GUI to perform all the common systemimager operations
    - Suggests http GUI. (OL)

(4) Implement pre/post-update scripts (to be ran with si_updateclient)

(2) Add a kernel-devel tree package, like those that ship with RedHat, 
    Ubuntu, etc. There's just enough data to build boot-kernel modules 
    against, but nothing else. 
    Ie: kernel-headers. (Jeremy Siadal suggestion)
=> OBSOLETE: we now use dracut.
