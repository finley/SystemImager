5.0.0 [ Not yet released ]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Linux distro supported: CentOS-6, CentOS-7, AlmaLinux-8, AlmaLinux-9,
  AlmaLinux-10, Fedora-29, Open SuSE-15, debian-10, debian-11, debian-12
- Now based on ISC Kea DHCP server (still support isc-dhcp-v3 legacy server.
- Imager GUI based on Plymouth (text also available)
- Web GUI for setup and replacement of si_monitortk (console and clients list)
  and netmootmgr
- New SystemImager configuration file based on json. More parameters and common
  API for bash/perl/php/ECMA script.
- PXE Menu GUI (si_mkbootserver)
- direct boot feature (no reboot after imaging)
- Put transfert protocols in plugins API instead of being hardcodded into
  imaging script. This includes (but not limited to):
  - rsync: works perfectly
  - scp: not working (lack password query in plymouth theme)
  - NFS: not working (mount nfs, then rsync from mount point to /sysroot)
  - docker/singularity: not working (download docker image and deploy it
    physically.
    => docker container is used on server in place of imagedir and allows image
    versionning)
  - bittorrent: not working (old client not supported, using new binaries instead
    of python stuffs that are hard to include in an initramfs)
  - flamethrower: not working (broken since protocols turned into modules)
  - rpm-list: not done
  - deb-list: not done
- Created an API for scripts (pre, main, post install) for:
  - Disk editting (partition, raid, lvm, mount points)
  - GUI messages
  - transfert
  - other
- removed old bittorrent client and replaced it with distro supported components
  - transmission-cli and transmission-create
  - scripts for torrent info
- Added many cmdline parameters including possibility to add breakpoints
  (si.break=<specific step>)
  A dedicated man has been added (systemimager.cmdline(7))
- Added sis_config_dir in systemimager.conf (stores imagename.conf)
  This file is downloaded by dracut logic and read just like local.cfg
  It hosts similar things as local.cfg so kernel cmdline is lighter.
  See systemimager.cmdline(7) for all parameters
- scripts dir reorganized
  /var/lib/systemimager/scripts/
                               pre-install
                               main-install
                               post-install
                               disks-layouts
                               network-configs
                               install-conf
- scripts are now optional. Mandatory things are disk-layout file and image
  name (can be set at last in main-install script).
- systemimager-monitor-rebooted service installation now handled by dracut
  module (no more post-install script required).
- Support for dhcp and static ip imager configuration within dracut cmdline
  parameters (ip= cmdline)
- Support for bootloader installation within dracut module (no more post-install
  script required).
- Support EFI booloader (grub2-efi and rEFInd). (clover planed)
- si_prepareclient now defaults to --no-uyok
  (except if --kernel, --image, --my-modules, --modules-dir is used)
- si_mkbootserver has now a systemd version.
- optimized partitionning code (aligned partitions, no hole between partitions,
  ability to create variable size partition beween 2 fixed size partitions
  thanks to xsl processing)
- disks-layout xml file is strictly validated using xsd
- network is now configured by imager in client. using a validated xml
  configuration file. it supports ipv6, ipv4, bonding, infiniband, aliases...
- flamethrower state dir is now /var/run/systemimager/flamethrower
- autoinstallscript.conf is now called disks-layout.xml and is directly used by
  imager. Not used anymore to build master script (which is optional)

4.5.0 [ Never released ]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Major rework of how initrd and kernel are provided.
  Now, all the initramfs creation process is handled by dracut.
  No more kernel build or initrd binaries build (except a few ones)
  Now kernel is taken from running distro
  Now initrd is built using dracut and a systemimager dracut module
- pod doc fixes (missing =back)
- rpm spec file dates fixes
- rpm spec file major rework and add for dracut-systemimager (dracut module)

4.3.0 [ Never released ]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Disabled SystemConfigurator in client script (systemconfigurator doesn't
  support new technologies like systemd, NetworkManager or grub/grub2)
- fixed si_netbootmond refusing to start when NET_BOOT_DEFAULT was set to "net".
- Fixed thread not finished warning when exitting si_monitortk
- Add option --include-system-firmware and --firmware-dir to si_prepareclient
  and si_mkbootpackage.
- Fix "unable to auto-detect kernel file" in si_prepareclient.
  (Thanks to David Livingstone for reporting this problem)
- Updated missing build dependancies (ubuntu 12.10)
- dhcp: Updated and moved dhclient-script and /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks
- dhcp: Add a patch so configure script can detect linux running kernel >= V3
- dhcp: reverted to V3.1.3 becasue V4+ have bug that makes dhclient ignore
  unconfigured interfaces that are down if not specified on the command line
  Bug tracked and reported upstream as: ICS#32935
- Enabled all network drivers, firmware, disck controlers, filesystems
  as modules.
- Replaced modules-init-tools (obsolete) with kmod-13
- build: Updated the build system by enforcing dependancies.
- build use make install instead of make install-exec in order
  to install devel files in the initrd_build_dir.
  This permit things like compiling udev using the new kernel
  headers. Thus, it is possible to have latest udev that can't
  build on old system like CentOS-6 (kernel headers too old)
- build: remove useless and devel files before generating the
  intird.img (/usr/share/* /share/* /lib/*.la /lib/*.a ...)
- Updated spec file:
  - Comments
  - Cleanup
  - Use of rpm directory for rpm specific patches
  - Updated BuildRequires: (quilt, ...)
- Enabled ext4 module in kernel
- Fix for new parted in Server.pm (avoid grepping "Disk Flags").
- Added:
  - Module init tools v3.12 (native modprobe required by udev)
- Upgraded:
  - parted to v3.1

  - gzip to 1.5
  - tar to 1.26
  - zlib to v1.2.5
- Use make install in LVM instead of manual copy (installs all binaries)
- Full rewrite of 95all.monitord_rebooted to have correct rebooted status
  on RHEL like distros. Try to comply with SysVInitScripts and systemd.
- Fixed mklib.bef so newer already installed libs aren't overwriten
- Fixed initrd_source/make.d/{udev,coreutils,util-linux}.rul
  using make install-exec so libtool is used to install binaries
  and thus avoiding copying the libtool wrapper instead of the
  real binaries.
- rpm: Added "BuildRequires: gperf" for udev build to spec file
- rpm: Added "BuildRequires: device-mapper-devel" to spec file
- rpm: Added "BuildRequires: quilt" is needed for building sysvinit-2.87dsf
- rpm: added rpm directory (similar to debian one) to permit non-debian build
  (includes patches that should only be used on non-debian systems)
- build: added <package>_build: rule in initrd_source/make.d/*.rul when missing
- Leave sufficient space before 1st partition so grub2 has enought room there.

- print image size on the console before starting imaging
- update the cluster configuration cache only when si_clusterconfig changes
  something
- do not clean-up si_monitortk threads on exit

- allow to specify size="*" in the LVM logical volumes definitions (in
  autoinstallscript.conf)
- now after a successful interactive image retrieval, si_getimage proposes to
  execute si_clusterconfig instead of si_addclients to define the groups of
  clients and assign images to them
- fixed a bug to correctly distribute files in the overrides that have the same
  size and timestamp of the files in the target client, but a different content
- fixed a bug to properly set the permission bitmask of the override root
  directory when the umask of the super-user in the image server doesn't use
  the standard value 0022
- fixed a bug with 2.4 kernels without udev to properly translate devfs disk
  names into the standard /dev names for hardware RAID disks that are using a
  non-standard naming schema (cciss, ida, rd, ...)
- fixed a bug to automatically skip udev network persistent naming rules in
  Debian or Debian-like distributions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- allow to specify multiple overrides per group
- support dynamic host groups (a list of clients generated by a result
  of a command executed on the image server)
- si_updateclient rewritten to be host-group compliant
- use systemconfigurator to re-create the boot-loader configuration at
  the end of the imaging process (this allows to totally redefine the
  partitioning schema in autoinstallscript.conf and automatically fix the
  boot-loader configuration, according to the new partitioning schema)
- added --imaging option to si_psh (if the installation parameter SSHD=y
  is used the --imaging allows to execute a command on a set of imaging
  clients)
- added the "priority" attribute to host groups (if a client belongs to
  multiple groups, the group with the higher priority will be used to
  choose the image for that client; regarding the overrides of the
  groups they'll be sorted by group priority: in case of file overlaps
  first hit wins)
- multiple optimizations in the host group translations
- removed the deprecated command si_mkautoinstalldiskette
- always use --my-modules with UYOK in ppc64-ps3 architectures to reduce
  the size of initrd.img

  initrd
- minor fix in the monitoring post-install script to correctly report
  the REBOOTED state in some versions of Red Hat / Fedora distro

  client is equipped with a different hardware respect to the golden
  client
- other minor fixes for a better error handling
- additions in manpages

3.9.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- introduced the concept of host group: groups can be listed or
  modified by the command si_clusterconfig(8)
- improved tftpbooting architecture: the default /tftpboot root has been
  moved to /var/lib/tftpboot (more LSB compliant) and it is a symlink to
  /usr/share/systemimager/boot. In this way there is no need to keep in
  sync kernel and initrd.img in /tftpboot anymore and we can support
  multiple boot packages (kernel + initrd.img) at the same time
- a lot of improvements in the monitoring engine: now it is possible
  keep monitored thousands of imaging clients with a low overhead of the
  monitoring daemon
- improved the si_monitortk GUI responsiveness
- added a clickable header on top of the clients table in si_monitortk
  GUI to sort the monitored clients with a single click
- added full support to filesystem LABELs and UUIDs
- added --flavor option to si_mkbootpackage: this allows to directly
  create a boot package into a new flavor
- added the --append option to si_mkclientnetboot: this allows to define
  installation parameters for the target clients by si_mkclientnetboot
  (without the need to manually edit the syslinux.cfg file)
- at the end of the imaging systemconfigurator now configures the same
  interface used to perform the auto-installation and not always eth0
- now at the end of the auto-installation systemconfigurator will
  automatically configure the same network device used to perform the
  installation (and not always and only eth0)
- more verbosity for systemconfigurator (useful for troubleshooting
  activities)
- systemimager-boot-<arch>-standard deb package has been splitted in
  systemimager-boot-<arch>-standard and systemimager-initrd-template-<arch>
- added priority classification of the entries in the TODO list
- a lot of bug fixes
- a new SystemImager boot screen ;-)

3.9.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added support for the PS3 architecture
- Improved support and compatibility with Debian (now deb packages can be
  automatically built from source using the new target "make deb")
- updated BOEL kernel to 2.6.21 (for i386 and x86_64)
- fixed a bug that broke si_mkautoinstalldisk
- free unused RAM of the initramfs (only with cpio initrd.img) after switching
  to tmpfs

  directory /var/lock/systemimager was not present
- added missing manpages
- remount the filesystems in read-only before giving-up when the umount
  fails at the end of the installation
- create all the swap partitions before the other filesystems in the autoinstall
  script: this avoids potential OOM conditions that could occur during the
  filesystem creation
- removed unused coreutils package from initrd.img
- removed unmaintained package imagemanip
- removed deprecated command si_mkbootmedia

3.9.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  required device drivers supported by the kernel without the need of an
  external DB (it is fully based on sysfs and modules.pcimap, shipped with
  kernel modules)
- added fast-reboot post install action (based on kexec): this allows to
  execute the imaged kernel without the need of an additional reboot
  through the BIOS
- added si_pushoverride command (a tool to synchronize overrides from
  the image server to the clients, defining cluster topologies and host
  groups)
- added support for minix UYOK initrd.img
- updated BOEL kernel to 2.6.20.4 (for i386 and x86_64)
- added systemconfigurator >= 2.2.9 dependency (required for by kexec
  stuff)

3.8.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- fixed a bug in the monitoring: REBOOTED state was not properly
  reported in some minimal image (without the command which)
- added "--config FILE" option to si_prepareclient and si_mkbootpackage
  (and removed from si_mkautoinstalldisk: the option must be used in
  commands that explicitly create an initrd.img from initrd_template) 
- do not hard-code common patterns of exclusion in si_getimage (created
  the configuration file /etc/systemimager/getimage.exclude)
- si_getimage didn't stop correctly the rsync daemon in the golden
  client, using rsync over ssh for the image retrieval

- now the installation parameter DEVICE can be used to bind the
  execution of the DHCP client on a single interface (instead of
  requesting an IP for all the available interfaces on the client)

  are automatically excluded during the image retrieval (i.e. /selinux
  files, LVM caches and backups, NFS stuff, etc.)
- fixed a problem in the detection of swap labels in RHEL distributions
- fixed a potential partition size problem with old versions of parted
  (< 1.6.23)
- fixed a bug that occurs when parted prints empty flags (now all the
  patition flags are correctly retrieved)
- now rsync is not restarted after si_mvimage, si_rmimage and si_cpimage
  (the restart could break the installation if these command were
  executed during the imaging)
- fixed a bug in SLES9 for UYOK (the --my-modules option was not able to
  correctly detect the filename of the loaded kernel modules)
- fixed a dependency problem with perl(XML::Simple) and perl(XML::Parser)

3.6.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Bug: discover patch was removed that allowed support of ICH7
       controllers.  
  Fix: upgrade to discover1

3.6.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Build system fix: change $(SRC_DIR)/$(DISCOVER_DIR)/lib/.libs to
  $(DISCOVER_DIR)/lib/.libs in libpath

3.6.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Broke discover and discover-data into seperate make files
- Simplified each
- The impetus was to fix a problem where wildcarded discover data files
  were a target, but they didn't exist until that target had been
    processed, resulting in a null target of "".  Fixed.
- depend on discover and discover data build stamps instead of the
  discover binary and data files.
- Was using wrong assignment operator (=: instead of =) for
  DISCOVER_DATA_FILES.  This meant that DISCOVER_DATA_FILES was being
  evaluated _once_ at the beginning of the build -- prior to the files
  being there.  Fixed.


3.6.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- make complete_source_tarball target for getting all source, including
  all versions of kernels (results in ~200M tarball)

  http://www.terrasoftsolutions.com/news/2004/2004-11-09.shtml
  Works with PPC64 series Macs running Linux, and in theory, most other Linux
  on PPC platforms. (AJ Hawks, David Smith, Owen Stampflee, Kai Staats)


3.4.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- use pre-install script to turn on dma for ata thingies.  See
  "/var/lib/systemimager/scripts/pre-install/99all.dma_on" (finley)
- include ssh as part of standard build, standard release (finley)
- renamed _all_ commands to use the "si_" prefix.  allows for tab 
  completion with a competent shell, like zsh ;-) (finley)
- took out sfdisk.rul -- haven't been using sfdisk for quite a while 
  now (finley)
- added util-linux.rul, for mkswap that supports >2G on ia32.  Recommended by
  Viet Hoang. (finley)
- update x86 kernel to 2.6.9 (John Aas)

SystemImager-3.3.2 (unstable) UNRELEASED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o dann frazier
  - merge in bug fixes from 3.2 branch

SystemImager-3.3.1 (unstable) 2004.06.01
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o brian e finley
  - new version of udpcast

  - lsimage: add --verbose option, and show image retrieval date
  - getimage: record image retrieval time in $image/etc/systemimager/IMAGE_RETRIEVAL_TIME

SystemImager-3.3.0 (unstable) 2004.04.14
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o brian e finley
  - add post-install script support
  - add pre-install script support


SystemImager-3.2.1 2004.04.05
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o dannf
  - 2.4.25 kernel
o Brian E. Finley
  - Server.pm: deal with 'noauto' mount option properly during autoinstall
o Jerry G. DeLapp/dann frazier
  - Add some strict checking around the APPEND entry in syslinux.cfg
  - Remove some unnecessary pieces of the default append line

SystemImager-3.2.0 2004.03.02
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o added multicast support via Flamethrower. -BEF-
o added imagemanip tool. -KC-
o many other bug fixes and improvements
o renamed init scripts to /etc/init.d/systemimager-server-<foo>
o Fix bug #[ 501646 ] prepareclient shouldn't killall rsyncs.
o added hardlink/parse files patch for rsync from stevegt (Closes #669565).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SystemImager-3.0.1 2003.03.30
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o updateclient: fixed bug [ 676908 ] GATEWAY not set in /local.cfg

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SystemImager-3.0.0 2002.12.08
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o static_dhcp and dynamic_dhcp went away.  Now simply use "dhcp".  See comments
  in autoinstall script on setting the host name to get the functionality that
  static_dhcp used to provide. -BEF-
o FAT support: FAT filesystems are now properly supported on i386 and ia64 (this
  includes vfat).  TODO #482984. -BEF-
o jfs support
o xfs support
o mvimage: Was failing if source image and destination image had the same
  name, even if a different location was specified (-directory). 
  Fixed bug# 548279. -BEF-
o mvimage: Now use rsync to copy the image over, then after a successful
  copy, we remove the old image directory.  (only if source image dir and
  destination image dir are different.)  If they're the same, we just use
  move(). -BEF-
o updateclient: Fixed bug number 426654.  We now strip the directory, 
  specified with -directory,  from the beginning of each path to exclude. -BEF-
o updateclient: The regex that was being created to exclude non-local 
  filesystems was parsing as a reference, as opposed to actual values. 
  Therefore, all filesystems ended up being excluded.  Including "/" (root). ;)

  Now we get a reference to the fstypes array with: 
  "my $fstypes = $config->fstype();"

  Then use it as an array with: "@$fstypes"

  This fixes bug #548156 -BEF-

o updateclient: Stopped accepting varying length (least unique) options.  As
  in, -verb to specify -verbose when -version is also an option.  Put
  Getopt::Long module back in and went back to using this for gathering all
  command line options.  Fixed Bug #547833 and #546599 -BEF-
o updateclient -a issues bad karma if dnsdomainname doesn't succeed in
  returning a domain name.  Simplified resolv.conf parsing code.
  Fixed Bug #547835 -BEF-
o updateclient: Go back to doing option validation in the body of updateclient,
  rather than asking AppConfig to do it.  This allows us to present more
  helpful output to the user. -BEF-
o updateclient: Put defaults into client.conf, rather than having them in the
  program itself. -BEF-
o updateclient: Only use croak() when something we are expecting to work breaks.
  For option validation and other expected user messages, do manually to provide
  more useful output. -BEF-
o updateclient: After gathering options from the config file, use simple
  variables throughout the code, rather than the AppConfig variable structure.
  This makes the code easier to read. -BEF-
o updateclient: Don't include -listing in the options anynmore, but recommend
  lsimage at the bottom. -BEF-
o updateclient: Help now indicates that user should put -directory "DIRECTORY"
  in quotes. -BEF-
o prepareclient: Fixed the bit about rsync needing a hostname.  No 
  longer need to prompt the user to allow us to add an entry, and we 
  leave the /etc/hosts file the way we found it.  Fixes bug #546600 -BEF-
o Autoinstall client would fail if a /local.cfg was used, but 
  GATEWAY was not specified.  Autoinstall now only tries to run the
  route command if GATEWAY is specified.  Fixed bug #547069. -BEF-
o The configdir variable was misnamed in the
  _get_list_of_IDE_and_SCSI_devices subroutine.  Changed to config_dir.
  This fixes bug #546606. -BEF-
o Re-Worked the devices_by_label.txt creation code.  Fixed bug #545335
  "prepareclient errors while processing labels". -BEF-
o Fixed bug #545328 "prepareclient -q doesn't wait for rsync". -BEF-
o Improved prepareclient messages. -BEF-
o Fixed bug #501650 "prepareclient needs better tmp files". -BEF-
o Fixed a bug in Server.pm where partitions 5 and above were not dealt
  with properly if using hardware RAID and non explicit partitioning. 
  This fixes bug #453549 -BEF-
o /etc/systemimager/rsyncd.conf is now a product of stub files.
  packages provide only the stubs that are relevent to them, and then
  regenerate /etc/systemimager/rsyncd.conf.
o added -kernel and -initrd flags to mkautoinstall{cd,diskette},
  allowing media generation using non-default files.  Closes #498741.
o added notes on using a DHCP v3 to the manual and the mkdhcpserver
  manpage.  Closes #502946.
o updateclient no longer references tftpboot.  Closes #507543.
o cpimage now has ssh support (thanks Thomas Schenk!)
o new systemimager-boot flavors
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
SystemImager-2.1.1 2002.02.05
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
o IMAGENAME variable added to local.cfg
o autoinstall will now use local.cfg variables even if
  ip address is obtained from dhcp
o addition of --append option to mkautoinstall* which allows
  additional kernel parameters to be set during the creations of 
  install media
o new /etc/systemimager/client.conf file which defines parameters
  on the SI client, including which filesystems to support on
  updateclient
o removal of beep executable in favor of 'echo -e "\a"'.  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SystemImager-2.1.0 2002.01.16
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
o first development release
o new arch - ia64
o prepareclient now supports devfs
o updateclient now supports Grub and Elilo through the use 
   of System Configurator

    install vfat partitions
o bootable partitions on golden-clients are now retained
o various bug fixes
o i386 kernel upgraded to 2.2.20

  (Brian)

initrd
------
o Added /dev/sdg* and /dev/sdh* entries. (Brian)
o We now use a Makefile to create the initrd.  This means that the rcS
  script and other important files are stored in CVS as text files that
  can be edited induhvidually. (go Dann!)

lsimage
-------
o no longer shows tftpboot as an image (Brian)

makeautoinstallcd, makeautoinstalldiskette, makedhcpserver, makedhcpstatic

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
SystemImager-1.5.0 2001.05.08
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The whole thing
---------------
o Added support for secure operation over SSH.

autoinstall initrd.gz
---------------------
o Fix bug [ #419185 ] rcS script matches multiple IPs.
o don't pull hosts file from imageserver if HOSTNAME is known.
o Fixed bug #407316.  Autoinstall was only working on eth0, even if 
  another interface got an IP address.  Thanks to James Oakley for 
  submitting this bug and a patch.

getimage
--------
o We were escaping $image so that IMAGE_LAST_SYNCED_TO was not being 
  set during autoinstall.  Fixed by un-escaping.
o Fixed bug where the "Would you like to update the autoinstall script 
  for this image? ([y]/n): " question would fail if the user actually 
  typed a "y".  Thanks to John Chabalko <john.chabalko@nbci.com> for 
  finding this bug.
o Fixed IP assignment question out of order bug.  Thanks to
  Cath Burrowes <cath@starbiz.com.au> for this patch.
o Added section to autoinstall.master scripts to deal with testing
  for and doing raidstop if necessary -- even if we're not 
  autoinstalling a raid image.
o Add " || shellout" to the end of almost everything in <image>.master
  for better error testing.
o Added some syntax checking for the -update-script option.  
o Fixed bug: changed stringwise operators to numeric operators where 
  appropriate.  This bug caused dynamic partitioning to fail when
  the golden client had 10 or more partitions.  Thanks to
  Efstathiadis Efstratios <stratos@bnl.gov> for finding this bug.

lsimage
-------
o New with this release!

pushupdate
----------
o New with this release!

updateclient
------------
o -imageserver is now depricated.  use -server.

makeautoinstallcd
-----------------
o Verify that the kernel and initrd.gz actually exist.  Suggested by 
  Greg Pratt <gpratt@valinux.com>.

makeautoinstalldiskette
-----------------------
o Verify that the kernel and initrd.gz actually exist.  Suggested by 
  Greg Pratt <gpratt@valinux.com>.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------
SystemImager-1.4.1 2001.04.20
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

addclients
----------
o Copy /etc/hosts -> /tftpboot/systemimager/hosts even if we don't 
  modify it.

autoinstall initrd.gz
---------------------
o don't pull hosts file from imageserver if HOSTNAME is known.
o Fixed bug #407316.  Autoinstall was only working on eth0, even if 
  another interface got an IP address.  Thanks to James Oakley for 
  submitting this bug and a patch.

autoinstall kernel
------------------
o added IBM ServeRAID support
o fixed eepro100 cmd_wait bug in the 2.2.18 kernel: 
  http://www.scyld.com/pipermail/eepro100/2001-January/001442.html

getimage
--------
o We were escaping $image so that IMAGE_LAST_SYNCED_TO was not being
  set during autoinstall.  Fixed by un-escaping.
o Fixed bug where the "Would you like to update the autoinstall script
  for this image? ([y]/n): " question would fail if the user actually
  typed a "y".  Thanks to John Chabalko <john.chabalko@nbci.com> for
  finding this bug.
o Added some syntax checking for the -update-script option.
o Fixed IP assignment question out of order bug.  Thanks to 
  Cath Burrowes <cath@starbiz.com.au> for this patch.

o Verify that the kernel and initrd.gz actually exist.  Suggested by 
  Greg Pratt <gpratt@valinux.com>.

makeautoinstalldiskette
-----------------------
o Verify that the kernel and initrd.gz actually exist.  Suggested by 
  Greg Pratt <gpratt@valinux.com>.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
SystemImager-1.4.0 2001.03.04
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

install 
-------
o Now uses the "install" program wherever possible
o Now works with /etc/rc.d/init.d/ or /etc/init.d.
o The imageserver now runs rsync as a daemon from an init script.  This
  is configured automatically at install time.

installclient
-------------
o Don't overwrite systemimager.exclude if it already exists.  Thanks to
  Wesley Smith <wessmith@engr.sgi.com>.

getimage
--------
o Improved support for ext3.  However, currently all journals are
  created at 15MB in size.  They are also the hidden type (good).
  Hopefully we can detect the existing size in the future.  For now
  the journal sizes can be set by modifying the <image>.master script.
o deal with networking properly on debian 2.2 and 2.1 systems
o now leaves it's mark -> "/etc/systemimager/IMAGE_LAST_SYNCED_TO"
o added the "replicant" option to the -ip-assignment option.
o -help and -version now exit with a status of 0.
o Added support for LABEL=/partition/label format in /etc/fstab.  This
  format is used in new (not upgrades) RedHat 7 installations.
o Improper usage statements no longer include the entire output from 
  the --help option.  In earlier versions this would often run the 
  usage correction statement off the screen.  Still provides a reminder
  to "-help".
o Now autodetects whether prepareclient left the partition data behind
  as "-explicit-geometry" or as megabytes.  If using megabytes, 
  getimage creates the autoinstall script in such a way that client 
  disks don't have to have the same geometry.  They can even be 
  significantly different sizes.  They can easily be much larger than 
  the original master client disks and can even be smaller...  (within 
  reason -- depends on specific partition scheme)
o Now uses the --numeric-ids rsync option.
o Fixed a harmless bug that made nasty output when blank lines were in
  the golden clients /etc/fstab file.  The fix was to tell getimage to
  skip blank lines in the /etc/fstab file.  

systemimager.exclude 
--------------------
o added additional exclusions for Debian.  Thanks to Wichert Akkerman
  for sending these in.

local.cfg
---------
o Now uses IMAGESERVER instead of DHCPSIADDR.  Of course, it is 
  backwards compatible so as not to completely confuse you. ;)

rsyncd.conf
-----------
o Change back to using one log file: /var/log/systemimager

afterburner
-----------
o Test for inetd and SIGHUP as is appropriate.
o Test for xinetd and SIGUSR1 as is appropriate.  Thanks to Dann 
  Frazier <daniel_frazier@hp.com> for pointing out that xinetd only 
  does a state dump with a SIGHUP and requres a SIGUSR1 to do a soft 
  reconfigure.
o Now works with /etc/rc.d/init.d/ or /etc/init.d.

updateclient
------------
o now leaves it's mark -> "/etc/systemimager/IMAGE_LAST_SYNCED_TO"
  noting the image the client was last synced to.
o added the -configure-from DEVICE option.  Only used with -autoinstall.
  Stores the network configuration for DEVICE in the /local.cfg file so
  that the same settings will be used during the autoinstall process.
o -help and -version now exit with a status of 0.
o Now uses the --numeric-ids rsync option.  Thanks to all who submitted
  info on this one.  This closes bug #123339.

goldenclient
------------
o Changed phraseology from "master client" to "golden client"

installclient
-------------
o /etc/systemimager/ directory is now properly created.  This closes bug
  #123337.  Thanks to James Oakley <joakley@solutioninc.com>.

prepareclient
-------------
o No longer use /etc/mtab to get mounted filesystems.  Now we use mount.
  Now works properly on systems with /etc/mtab linked to /proc/mounts.
  Thanks to the folks below for helping debug and test this code:
  o Austin Gonyou <austin@coremetrics.com>
  o Chad A. Hughes <chughes@coremetrics.com>
o removed ext3 stuff.  getimage now does all the ext3 stuff.
o -help and -version now exit with a status of 0.
o Offers to add "127.0.0.1 $hostname" to /etc/hosts.
o Now defaults to using megabytes to store partition information.  Can
  be told to leave explicit partitioning information for getimage with
  the -explicit-geometry option.
o What was I thinking in v1.3.0 with the -no-rsyncd option?!?  Don't try
  this, folks.  It would record your imageserver's partition information
  as if it were the client's.

makedhcpstatic
--------------
o Automatically send a HUP signal to dhcpd (if running) to make it
  re-read the freshly modified config file.

makedhcpserver
--------------
o Now supports specification of an imageserver that is a different
  machine from the dhcp server.
o Added patches from John Goebel <jgoebel@valinux.com> to allow for
  other non-systemimager specific advanced options!

autoinstallclient
-----------------
o added support for 3c905 
o added support for 3c59x
o added support for pcnet32
o added support for Alteon AceNIC/3Com 3C985/NetGear GA620 Gigabit
o added support for 3ware Hardware ATA-RAID (EXPERIMENTAL)
o Smallerized.  More stuff done by BusyBox.
o Now using hardlinks for BusyBox.  Thanks for this suggestion go 
  to: Rob Latham <rlatham@plogic.com>.
o Added mawk.  Funky and easily breakable sed stuff can now be done
  with mawk.
o Changed to dhclient.  dhclient allows us to try all interfaces for
  DHCP.  This will solve some instances where a system would boot the 
  autoinstall media off the network, but then couldn't get an IP 
  address for the running OS.  dhclient also allows us to specify the 
  imageserver as seperate from the dhcp server.
o Bug fix:  Was using POSIX [[:blank:]] in sed statement to find and 
  change spaces and tabs to single spaces.  Sed version changed and no 
  longer behaved properly.  Spaces work fine with the v1.3.0 client but
  tabs will give you errors.
o Enforce that the client sleeps 35s before trying to use the network.  
  Even if using local.cfg.

autoinstall scripts 
-------------------
o Added the -L option to sfdisk.  Recommended by Matthew Marlowe 
  <mmarlowe@jalan.com>.
o Fixed a bug where autoinstall of clients with reiserfs root partitions
  fails.  The -notail option must be used, otherwise lilo will complain
  about a hole in a mapfile and not make the disk bootable.  Thanks to 
  Matthew Marlowe <mmarlowe@jalan.com> for submitting this bug.
o Turn on swap space after initializing.  In the past we didn't use the
  swap space at all.  Go ahead and use it to help out in low memory 
  situations.
o Now uses the --numeric-ids rsync option.
o Fixed the bit where egrep is used to test for mounted filesystems 
  (indicating a running machine that shouldn't be touched).  grep is now
  used and no error messages should be seen.

makeautoinstallcd
-----------------
o -help and -version now exit with a status of 0.

makeautoinstalldiskette
-----------------------
o -help and -version now exit with a status of 0.
o Test for either superformat or fdformat.  Use superformat if both exist.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
SystemImager-1.3.0 2000.10.04
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- autoinstall kernel -- Patched with:
                        - http://people.redhat.com/mingo/raid-patches/raid-2.2.17-A0
                        - http://www.tux.org/pub/devel/reiserfs/linux-2.2.17-reiserfs-3.5.25-patch.gz
- prepareclient -- <<<<< Don't use this feature to update    >>>>>
                   <<<<< your master scripts.  I must have   >>>>>
                   <<<<< been up *really* late the night I   >>>>>
                   <<<<< did this.  See comments for v1.4.0. >>>>>
                   Added the -n or -no-rsyncd option.  This allows
                   you to run prepareclient from a chrooted image
                   and then run getimage with the -s option to
                   update your master autoinstall script.
- autoinstall media -- Added support for software RAID.
- getimage -- Added support for software RAID.
- getimage -- Fixed a bug where filesystem creation and mounting was 
              done based on the order of entries in the fstab file.
              If /boot came before /, for example, then the resultant
              autoinstall script would unsuccessfully try to mount 
              /boot first.  Mount points are now sorted.  Thanks to
              Dale Harris <rodmur@valinux.com> for finding this one.
- getimage -- Fixed a bug where fstab files containing tabs or with
              spaces at the beginning of a line might not be parsed
              properly.  This could potentially result in an 
              improperly created autoinstall script.

SystemImager-1.2 2000.09.25
- makedist -- Only used by me really (Brian).  Now automatically sets the
              version number in each of the appropriate files.
- prepareclient -- No longer messes with /etc/rsyncd.conf.  Now uses a
                   temporary configuration file: /tmp/rsyncd.conf and
                   references it like this:
                     rsync --daemon --config=/tmp/rsyncd.conf
- afterburner -- modified to add [tftpboot] section to existing 
                 rsyncd.conf file.
- updateclient -- Now looks for systemimager.exclude in /etc/systemimager/.
- updateclient -- Figures out root device from /etc/fstab and appends
                  LAST_ROOT=device to lilo.conf entry when -autoinstall is
                  issued.  This allows for placing a local.cfg file in the 
                  root filesystem prior to rebooting after running 
                  updateclient -autoinstall.
- updateclient -- added the -autoinstall option.  Courtesy of
                  Alan Lambert <alambert@epicrealm.com>.  Allows you to 
                  tell any machine that is currently running to autoinstall 
                  itself the next time you reboot.  *Very* cool idea!  No 
                  mucking about with removeable media or that tricky PXE 
                  stuff for remote re-installs.
- makedhcpstatic -- added support for restarting dhcp daemon.
- addclients -- images are now presented in chronological order from
                oldest to newest.  newest is now the default that is 
                presented.
- addclients -- made the descriptions more clear and broke it up into 3 
                sections.
- rsyncd.conf -- now has entry for /tftpboot and the /var/log/systemimager
                 entry is added on a per image basis.
- autoinstalldiskette -- now uses a 1.44M floppy!
                         - faster creation
                         - faster booting
                         - fewer floppy failures
- autoinstallclient -- now uses rsync v2.4.6
- autoinstallclient -- now uses smaller libraries, allowing for larger 
                       kernels and more utilities!
- autoinstallclient -- support for use *without* DHCP!  See the FAQ for 
                       more info.
- autoinstallclient -- kernel includes support for software RAID and for
                       reiserfs.
- autoinstallclient -- added support for post install options of beeping,
                       shutdown, or reboot.
- autoinstallclient -- can now be used *without* DHCP.
- autoinstallclient -- added support for ext3.
- autoinstallclient -- added support for reiserfs.
- autoinstallclient -- added beep utility.
- autoinstallclient -- added mkraid and raidstart utilities.
- autoinstallclient -- added mkreiserfs.
- autoinstallclient -- added Wes Smith's patch to sedding for the HOSTNAME.
- autoinstallclient -- added some diagnostics.
- autoinstallclient -- added ifconfig and route utilities.
- autoinstallclient -- using rsync again for everything except network
                       boot installs.
- getimage -- you can now specify the path to the image directory with
              the -directory option.  Suggested by Wesley Smith 
              <wessmith@engr.sgi.com>.
- getimage -- added the -server option to allow copying an image from one
              imageserver to another.  Suggestion and example code
              contributed by Phil Champon <pchampon@valueweb.net>.
- getimage -- modified the way getimage deals with filesystems to make it 
              much easier to add new filesystems to the supported list.
- getimage -- added support for post install options of beeping,
              shutdown, or reboot.
- getimage -- added support for ext3 and reiserfs.
- getimage -- changed the mke2fs options to the conservative defaults.
              Hopefully soon we will be able to detect existing settings and 
              re-create those by partition.

SystemImager-1.1 2000.05.26
- updateclient -- Fixed a bug.  root --> / was not becoming the default 
  if the -directory option was not used and updateclient was exiting 
  quietly.  Just an if/then/else issue.
- syslinux RPM -- Bug in the syslinux RPM prevented proper creation of 
  bootable CD image with makeautoinstallcd.  This is fixed as of 
  syslinux-1.48-2.i386.rpm.  (Note: this was not a bug in syslinux, just
  a bug in the packaging)
- FAQ-HOWTO updates and fixes.
- makeautoinstallcd -- fixed a bug where the output file was not created
  properly unless an absolute path was given.  Now works with an absolute
  path, a relative path, or just a filename (to be placed in the current
  working directory).
- prepareclient -- (also part of the va-systemimager-client RPM)
  Implemented a delay between killing a running rsync daemon and starting
  up the fresh one.
- prepareclient -- now tests for hostname in /etc/hosts for rsync.
- autoinstallcd.iso -- autoinstallcd ISO image put up on the download 
  site. (3 Meg)
- prepareclient -- gave it a real usage statement.  Behavior is 
  no longer to traipse upon the network with tftp, but to use the 
  utilities on the client system.  Options are -help, -version, and -quiet
- va-systemimager-client RPM -- now you *must* run prepareclient after
  installing the client RPM.  This is so that you don't unwittingly have
  an rsync daemon running sharing things you don't want shared.
- added support for debian.  Let me know how it goes.

SystemImager-1.0 2000.05.02
- The name changed ever so slightly ;)
- Lots of little things -- bug fixes and what not.  Ease of use stuff.
- added the "makeautoinstallcd" command.  This allows you to create a 
  bootable 3 Meg iso9660 image that you can burn to a CD.
- addclients -- If you give it new hostnames for a range of existing 
  IP addresses, it now replaces the existing hostnames instead of 
  ignoring them.

SystemImager-0.24beta 2000.03.09
- makedhcpstatic -- Modified to try /var/state/dhcp/dhcpd.leases, then
  /etc/dhcpd.leases, and as a last resort /var/log/messages.
- autoinstall system -- The autoinstalldiskette is no longer based on
  Tom's Root Boot.  It is now a miniature distribution of my own.  It
  boots using syslinux.  This also allows us to use the same kernel and
  root filesystem for both diskette booting and network booting via
  pxelinux (part of syslinux).
- rsyncd.conf -- added "chroot = no".  
  Brian Luethke <luethke@msr.epm.ornl.gov> pointed out that if a users
  UID/GID is different on a client (from the imageserver) when doing an 
  "updateimage", the client ends up with a file owned by a user that 
  doesn't exist.  By using "chroot = no", rsync is able to translate UIDs
  to the appropriate user on the client system.  If a user with the same
  name does not exist on the client, then it still gets a UID that belongs
  to no user.  Sigh...
- systemimager.exclude -- added /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-*
- FAQ-HOWTO -- updated the FAQ and combined it and the HOWTO together.
- INSTALL -- got rid of this document and added it's contents to the README.
  Cleaning up clutter is always good.
- install -- allows a -q, -quiet, or --quiet option.
- install -- you can now run install from any fully qualified or relative path.
- install -- relocated /systemimager/images to /var/spool/systemimager/images.
  In the future, the installer will present you with a choice for the _real_
  location.
- install -- no longer using a tarball within a tarball.
- install -- added more statements to tell you what it's doing.
- install -- added some additional error checking.
- install -- took out the bit that copied /etc/hosts to /systemimager/etc/.
- install -- nothing gets installed to /systemimager.
- install -- now puts documentation in /usr/doc/systemimager-$version.
- install -- now puts binaries in /usr/sbin/.
- install -- no longer asks if you want to create an autoinstalldiskette.
  This was confusing and caused people to think they had to create a diskette
  at that point, or they had missed their chance.
- rsyncd.conf -- added *.deb, *.rpm, and *.dbf to the don't compress directive.
- rsyncd.conf -- removed the [etc] and [installstuff] blocks.  These small 
  files will now be transferred via tftp.  tftp is now necessary anyway in 
  order to support network booting.
- rsyncd.conf -- now logs transactions to /var/log/systemimager.  This can
  be used to track the progress of clients autoinstalling or updateimage(ing).
- addclients -- now asks you for the number of the first machine and the
  number of the last machine (instead of "how many machines").
- addclients -- now presents you with a list of avaliable images and tests
  to be sure that specified image exists.  (suggestion courtesy of Stephen
  Greene <sgreene@valinux.com>.
- addclients -- changed to create host entries in /etc/hosts only.  No more
  messing about with the non-intuitive (dual) location of
  /systemimager/etc/hosts.
- getimage -- has been "perlized" by Wesley Smith <wessmith@engr.sgi.com>.
- getimage and therefore $image.master -- NISDOMAIN is now added to 
  /etc/sysconfig/network (for both dhcp and static) and NETWORK and 
  DOMAINNAME are added to static.  
  (patch sent in by Michael P. McLeod <mmcleod@bcm.tmc.edu>).
- getimage and therefore $image.master -- HOSTNAME is only added to 
  /etc/sysconfig/network when using static IP addresses.  This way, the host 
  gets it's hostname via DHCP along with it's IP address -- and they match!  
  Even if they change!  This means you can change the hostname by simply 
  changing the IP address assigned by dhcpd (based on MAC addres).
- getimage and therefore $image.master -- pointed new images to 
  /var/spool/systemimager/images/$image and reflected this in the
  /etc/rsyncd.conf file.

SystemImager-0.23 2000.02.14
- getimage and therefore $image.master -- only $HOSTNAME is written to 
  /etc/HOSTNAME and /etc/sysconfig/network instead of $HOSTNAME.$DOMAINNAME
- getimage and therefore $image.master -- fixed a bug where filesystems were
  not created and mounted in the appropriate order.  (bug submitted by 
  Tanmoy Bhattacharya <tanmoy@lanl.gov>)
- getimage and therefore $image.master -- took out the bit at the end that
  tries to make noise and ends up writing "\a\a\a\a\a\a\a"
- getimage and therefore $image.master -- Ian McLeod <ian@valinux.com> 
  observed compression saturating CPU utilization on an imageserver when 
  installing only 8 clients simultaneously.  Turned compression off during 
  autoinstall, and observed moderate CPU utilization whilst installing 21 
  clients simultaneously.  Now I need to go to Gigabit Ethernet on the 
  imageserver to relieve the network bottleneck.
- getimage and therefore $image.master -- added an example of how to customize 
  the sfdisk statements.  If you are installing the same image to clients with
  disks that are physically different in any way from the client you got the 
  image from, you should customize your sfdisk statements according to the 
  example you will find in your $image.master script after you do your getimage.

SystemImager-0.22 1999.12.29 (I'm getting Altitude sickness -- no more
                              declaring the elevation.  Well, I'm not really
                              sick, not that way, anyway, but it's not really 
                              accurate.  I didn't do all of the work on v0.21
                              at 655 feet, for example.  Oh, well ;)
- Ari, sorry I haven't incorporated your changes yet.  Haven't been able to 
  review them thoroughly and test them.  But they look good and will get in 
  soon.
- added 5 more seconds to each of the two sleep statements on the 
  autoinstalldiskette.
- fixed a bug in the autoinstalldiskette (found by Susan Coghlan <smc@lanl.gov>
  and separately found by Robert Saft <zardoz@valinux.com> and 
  Ted Arden <ted@valinux.com>).  Both new and old mkswap commands were on the
  diskette, but the new one was in /tmp/ ?  Moved the new (large swap capable)
  mkswap command to /usr/bin on the diskette and got rid of the old one.
- fixed a bug in the autoinstalldiskette (found by Susan Coghlan <smc@lanl.gov>)
  that had to do with finding the nodes host name based on it's IP address.  If
  the node had an IP address of 1.1.1.24, but 1.1.1.244 came earlier in the 
  /systemimager/etc/hosts file, it would match the 1.1.1.244 address and assume
  it was the corresponding host.
- do chown afterwards, so that files in tarball don't have to be owned by root
- autoinstalldiskette -- umount all non-floppy filesystems and make noise when 
  done, in addition to dropping eth0, but don't halt (so that noise continues)

SystemImager-0.21 1999.12.07 at 655 feet (Dallas, Tx)
- install and prepareclient -- bux fix submitted by Susan Coghlan 
  <smc@acl.lanl.gov>: dots (.) and dashes (-) in function names apparently 
  break with bash2.  Also recommended a change in the way prepareclient 
  deals with /etc/systemimager.exclude.
- addclient -- changed some of the interactive defaults as indicated by [x],
  and added some error checking.
- install -- bug in the verbage -- fixed by Ari Jort.
- FAQ -- updated by Ari Jort.

SystemImager-0.20 1999.11.22 at 655 feet (final touches made in Dallas, Tx)
                                 (but coded at several different altitudes)
- overall theme for changes -- scripts for everything!!!  You should be
  ready to autoinstall your first client in (basically) three steps:
  - run install and answer all it's questions and follow it's instructions
  - run prepareclient on the "master" client
  - run getimage on the imageserver
  Now you should be ready to boot your first autoinstall client off the
  autoinstalldiskette.
- updateimage -- Major overhaul.  Now written in perl.  Just try it.
- makedhcpstatic -- decided to continue using /var/log/messages as
  the dhcpd.leases file can be found in many different places and
  for some reason, /var/log/messages is always in the same place ;).
- renamed /systemimager/installscripts to /systemimager/installstuff
- moved /systemimager/clientstuff into /systemimager/installstuff
- changed all instances where "systemimager" was used to refer to the
  image server with "imageserver".  It just makes more literary sense.
- makedhcpserver -- created it!  This script will ask you appropriate 
  questions and create a starter dhcpd.conf file for you *and* include 
  the information necessary for autoinstalldiskette clients to find the 
  imageserver.
- prepareclient -- now pulls client scripts, client bin, and etc stuff
  onto "master" client _before_ getting image.  Places updateimage in 
  /usr/bin on client.
- $imagename.master -- cleaned up the static IP section (this will be
  automated later) and added an ifconfig eth0 down so that the client
  will no longer respond to pings after it has halted (so you can tell
  when a headless client is finished autoinstalling).
- addclients -- created it!  This script will create the symbolic links
  necessary for your autoinstall clients to autoinstall.
- autoinstalldiskette -- added the aic7xxx module (an Adaptec SCSI module).
  This means support for the VA Linux Systems FullOn servers.  I also 
  discovered that with certain ethernet switches it takes about 30 seconds,
  after the interface comes alive, before they will transmit data on that
  port.  It seems that the dhcp request would go out during that time
  period and that the dhcp client would give up.  The autoinstalldiskette
  now brings up the ethernet interface with a bogus address of 127.0.0.2
  which makes the interface live (as far as the switch is concerned).  
  The autoinstalldiskette then sleeps until after the switch starts 
  transmitting, and then issues it's dhcp request which is serviced 
  almost immediately.
- other stuff what I can't remember...

SystemImager-0.19 1999.10.14 at 655 feet (Dallas, Tx)
- autoinstalldiskette -- made it truely generic again.  no longer necessary 
  to modify the diskette image during install.  this means that the server
  system no longer requires ram disk capability!  And it makes the install
  floppy more flexible -- you don't have to modify it if you change the IP
  address of the server.  This is done by adding the IP address of the 
  imageserver as the last name server entry in dhcpd.conf.  If it 
  happens to be running a nameserver, great!  If not, the entry will be 
  ignored.  The client then takes this last name server entry and assumes 
  it to be the imageserver.
- prepareclient -- no longer customized at install time.  this script is
  also now generic.  it simply asks for the imageserver's ip address when
  it is run.
- install -- modified appropriately to deal with the above changes.
- install -- added some error checking to the yes/no questions.
- prepareclient -- added some error checking to the yes/no questions.
- autoinstalldiskette -- added some error checking so that even if certain
  network related errors occur, the system will not hang and you can still
  login to the client to see what's up. 
- VERSION -- started keeping separate versions for the autoinstall diskette
  and SystemImager (so's that I don't have to modify the image of the 
  "generic" diskette just to change the release number.
- getimage -- take "# pounded out lines" in $image/etc/fstab into 
  consideration.

SystemImager-0.18 1999.10.05 at 34,000 feet (Albuquerque, NM to Dallas, TX)
- getimage -- added lines to the /systemimager/installscripts/$image.master
  script that can be uncommented if clients will use static IPs after the
  install.
- makedhcpstatic -- created it.  No more mucking about trying to punch in
  gobs of mac addresses.  Simply populate /systemimager/etc/hosts with all
  the relevant client and server IP addresses, specify a dynamic range in
  your dhcpd.conf file, and image your clients with the autoinstall 
  diskette in the order you want the IP addresses assigned.  After
  booting your systems, you can run this script to make the static entries
  for you!  This script reverse resolves IP addresses to hostnames via the 
  /etc/hosts file on the server and uses hostnames instead of IP addresses 
  in the dhcpd.conf file.  This way, you can change a hosts IP address by 
  simply changing the entry in /etc/hosts on the image server.
- Perl -- started writing server-side scripts in Perl.  Existing server 
  side scripts will be converted to Perl in time.  It just got too messy 
  in Bourne. ;)
- modified the autoinstall diskette so that:
  - it only has a 5 second delay during boot
  - it uses extended VGA and doesn't ask your opinion
  - it shows it's name as "SystemImager-autoinstalldiskette-$version"

SystemImager-0.17 1999.10.05 at 655 feet (Dallas, Tx)
- getimage -- changed rsync options so that it actually *gets* all
  of the filesystems now that we're no longer assuming only one
  filesystem.
- getimage -- chmod +x prepareclient script after modifying
- getimage -- no longer bother unmounting before halting in $image.master
- VERSION -- started including this file

SystemImager-0.16 1999.10.04 at 655 feet (Dallas, Tx)
- getimage -- overwrite $image.master every time.   
- getimage -- create $image.master script with the ability to 
  partition *each disk* *exactly* like on the master client
  by pulling data left behind by "prepareclient".
- prepareclient -- rsync over a static sfdisk and get *exact*
  partition scheme for *each* disk (as per /proc/partitions).
  store this information in /etc/partitionschemes/$drivename
  for retrieval by "getimage" once image is on the imageserver.

SystemImager-0.15 1999.09.19 at 655 feet (Dallas, Tx)
- getimage -- use rsync to get mount information via /etc/mtab
  instead of asking if network filesystems are mounted
  and exclude all non-ext2 filesystems from the get.  Perhaps
  we'll become more flexible and pull other appropriate filesystems
  in the future.
  (This idea courtesy of "Ari Jort" <ajort@valinux.com>)

SystemImager-0.14 1999.09.19 at 655 feet (Dallas, Tx)
- modify getimage to assume only swap and root, and therefore to use 
  the -x option in rsync to constrain to one filesystem.
- modify getimage to ask questions and do some discovery
- modify getimage to create $imagename.master in installscripts
- get rid of SystemImager.default.sh
- add warning about floppy drives to makemeadiskette/install.s

SystemImager-0.13 1999.09.15 at 33,000 feet (Albuquerque, NM to Dallas, TX)
- maybe I hadn't finished the install script...  added a kill -HUP for inetd
- also added a kill -HUP for inetd to prepareclient
- modified prepareclient to create rsyncd.conf if it didn't exist at all

SystemImager-0.12 1999.09.15 at 655 feet (Dallas, TX)
- finished install script -- for installing SystemImager on the image server
- install script now prompts you to create your first autoinstall diskette
- wrote prepareclient -- for preparing a client to have it's image taken
- renamed /systemimager/installstuff to /systemimager/installscripts
- added installscripts entry to 
  /systemimager/serverstuff/etc/rsyncd.conf.starterfile 
- updated /systemimager/clientstuff/bin/updateimage to not present 
  "installscripts" when doing a listing.
- finished modifications to autoinstall diskette to take advantage of using 
  rsync to grab the initial install script

SystemImager-0.11 1999.09.14 at 35,000 feet (Newark, NJ to Dallas, TX)
- changed mode of initial image install so that no tftp is necessary.
  now using rsync to get client specific install script.  
  (Idea courtesy of "Ari Jort" <ajort@valinux.com>)
- added install script -- for installing SystemImager on the image server

SystemImager-0.10 1999.09.12 at 32,000 feet (Dallas, TX to New York, NY)
- added comments to dhcpd.conf.systemimager.example file
- added tftp to /usr/bin with man page in /usr/man
- tftp is now used to pull down scripts using the more flexible scheme 
  described below.
- changed mode of initial image install so that no nfs is involved and also to 
  allow greater flexibility/manageability geared towards client 
  customization/different images.  
  (This idea courtesy of "Bartosz Ilkowski" <barbi@danforthcenter.org>)

SystemImager-0.9 1999.09.07 at swamp level (Princeton, NJ)
- changed the name from TheLamp to SystemImager
- changed script names/directories/variables, etc. as appropriate
- expanded the exclude list in the getimage script

TheLamp-0.8
- who knows?

TheLamp-0.7
- who knows?

TheLamp-0.6
- get /etc/resolv.conf from dhcpcd -- no more static configuration on diskette
- pump is not necessary -- can get what we need from dhcpcd
- get get DNS domain name from /etc/resolv.conf
- added sfdisk to /bin with man page in /usr/man
- removed the static sfdisk from /thelamp/installstuff
- added rsync to /bin with man page in /usr/man
- removed the static rsync from /thelamp/installstuff
- added mkswap with >128Meg support to /bin with man page in /usr/man
- modified the /thelamp/installstuff/install-a-genie script
