  * Add missing build-dep on rsync. (Closes: #400069)
  * si_prepareclient execs file, so add a systemimager-client dependency
    on the file package
  * If the client is using udev, fetch /dev/.static as /dev during

    Otherwise, things like bootloader install won't work. (Closes: #398219)
  * Fix an FHS violation by placing custom boot files in /var instead
    of /usr. si_mkautoinstall* don't automatically detect and use these
    flavors yet. Users will need to pass explicit -kernel and -initrd
    parameters to make use of them until this is fixed. (Closes: #398147)

    Workaround for #359354.

    client are specified and hostname is not. Thanks to lumen for the
    patch. (Closes: #369012)
  * Disable mkbootmedia - I never finished this work, and probably
    never will. Its a shame, I still think its a great idea.
    Users should continue using the mkautoinstall* scripts for now.
    Thanks to Ryan Nowakowski for pointing out that it was being installed.

systemimager (3.0.1-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * split out binary-arch & binary-indep.
    Note that the split is somewhat abnormal - the binary-arch target will
    build an arch: all package - however, the package it creates is determined
    by the build-arch.  For example, on i386 it will build
    systemimager-boot-i386-standard, and on ia64 it will build
    systemimager-boot-ia64-standard.  I think this fits the spirit of the
    split (binary-arch should build the packages that can only be built on
    this architecture), although it differs from how it is defined.
    I also realize that this won't make the buildd's happy - they don't 
    expect binary-all packages to pop out during a binary-arch build.
    However, the buildd's can't help with systemimager builds anyway,
    so I'll need to revert to P-a-S status anyway.  Closes: #208724
