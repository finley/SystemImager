#   You can use this file as a template by copying it to the floppy diskette 
#   for the desired machine.  Be sure to edit the values below, replacing each
#   of them with the appropriate values for your site.
#
#   Priority:
#   1) Settings received from a DHCP server are used by default for all
#      settings that can be recieved from the DHCP server (currently this
#      excludes ETHER_SLEEP and SSH_USER).  See "man mkdhcpserver" for more 
#      information on making these settings at the DHCP server.
#   2) Settings from a local.cfg file on the root of a target machine,
#      prior to running "updateclient -autoinstall", will override DHCP
#      settings.
#   3) Settings from a local.cfg file on a floppy diskette will override
#      settings made anywhere else.
#
#   Below are the contents of an example local.cfg file.  Defaults are 
#   indicated (in parentheses).  (DHCP) means that the default is to determine 
#   said value via DHCP.

# Section 1: Each of these settings can be made independently of the others
#

#
# Name that you want assigned to your target machine (DHCP)
#
#HOSTNAME=www1

#
# DNS domain name (DHCP)
#
#DOMAINNAME=systemimager.org

#
# IP address of the image server (DHCP)
#
#IMAGESERVER=10.0.0.3

#
# Name of the script you want to use to install this machine
#
#SCRIPTNAME=compute_node (useful in netboot environments)
#
# or Name of the image you want installed on this machine
#
#IMAGENAME=oracle_db_server-1.0 (determined by hostname)

#
# Number of seconds to wait, after bringing up the network interface, before
# making a DHCP request.  Can't be set at the DHCP server as sites that need
# this will need it in order to talk to the DHCP server!  ("0")
#
#ETHER_SLEEP=35

#
# Server to which client will send syslog messages during install. (blank)
#
#LOG_SERVER=10.0.0.3

#
# Port used by syslog daemon on the syslog server. (514)
#
#LOG_SERVER_PORT=514

#
# TMPFS_STAGING tells your autoinstallclient to spool the image into a tmpfs
# prior to laying it down on disk.  It is not certain that this is always
# a good thing to do.  And if you're feeling gutsy and want to try it, be
# sure that your (memory + swap) is at least twice the size of your image
# or your image transfer will fail when the tmpfs filesystem gets full!!!
#
# If unsure, say "no".
#
#TMPFS_STAGING=no


################################################################################
#
# Section 2: All of these settings depend on each other.  If you set one,
#            set them all.
#

#
# Network device that you want to use for the install.
#
#DEVICE=eth0

#
# IP Address to assign to DEVICE
#
#IPADDR=10.0.0.99

#
# Netmask to assign to DEVICE
#
#NETMASK=255.255.255.0

# Network address for DEVICE (not the host address, but the network address)
#
#NETWORK=10.0.0.0

#
# Broadcast address for DEVICE
#
#BROADCAST=10.0.0.255

#GATEWAYDEV=eth0

# Section 4: Multicast support using Flamethrower
#
#   You cannot use multicast and SSH at the same time.  If you specify both,
#   SSH will be used (it's the conservative decision).
#
# Port number on the imageserver where Flamethrower advertises it's directory
# of available modules.

#FLAMETHROWER_DIRECTORY_PORTBASE=9000
