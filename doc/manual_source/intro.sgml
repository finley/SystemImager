    <title>SystemImager Overview</title>
    <para>
	<application>SystemImager</application>, a component of the
	<application>System Installation Suite</application>, is software
	that automates <application>GNU/Linux</application> installs,
	software distribution, and production deployment.
    </para>
    <para>
	One key feature of SystemImager is that it is distribution-agnostic and
	is able to support heterogeneous hardware. This allows the deployment of any
	kind of GNU/Linux distribution (standard or even customized) to any kind of target
	machine. The main goal of the project is to make deployment of large numbers of
	computers easy. Typical environments include computer labs and render farms,
	but SystemImager has proven particularly popular in clustered computing environments,
	such as grid and high performance computing.
    </para>
    <para>
	Another design feature that facilitates GNU/Linux distribution and hardware
	independence is that <application>SystemImager</application> works with
	file based (rather than block based) system images. An image is stored as a
	directory hierarchy of files representing a comprehensive snapshot of a
	machine, containing all the files and directories from the root of that
	machine's file system. Images can be acquired in multiple ways, including
	retrieval from a sample system (golden client), or by direct generation on the
	SystemImager server using third-party tools.
    </para>
    <para>
	The standard method of image creation involves cloning of a
	pre-installed machine, the golden-client. In this way, the user can customize
	and tweak the golden-client's configuration according to his needs, verify it's
	proper operation, and be assured that the image, once deployed, will behave in
	the same way as the golden-client. Incremental updates are possible by syncing
	an updated golden-client to the image, then syncing that image to deployed
	machines using the si_updateclient command.  Images are hosted in a central
	repository on a server, called the image-server, and they can be distributed
	among the clients using different transports: rsync (the default), multicast
	(via Flamethrower1), SSL encrypted rsync (using a SSH tunnel), and via
	BitTorrent.

    <title>How SystemImager Works</title>
    <para>
      SystemImager allows you to retrieve an entire system image from a
      golden client, which is a manually installed, customized machine, to
      an image server, which is the machine that will hold and distribute
      system images.  You can deploy the images to any number of client
      systems from the image server.
    </para>
    <para>
      After initial image deployment, you can update the client systems by
      syncing them from an updated image on the image server.  Updates are fast
      and efficient because only the modified parts of files are pulled to
      the clients.
    </para>
    <section>
      <title>Supported Distributions</title>
      <para>
	<application>SystemImager</application> uses 
	<ulink url="http://wiki.systemimager.org/index.php/System_Configurator">SystemConfigurator</ulink>
	to custom configure autoinstall clients for specific distributions.
	Through <application>SystemConfigurator</application>,
	<application>SystemImager</application> supports all
	major <application>GNU/Linux</application> distributions and most
	others, including custom or in-house distributions. Using "footprints",
	SystemConfigurator works with distributions based on their system
	configuration style rather than needing to know the name of the
	distribution. To determine a system's footprint,
	<application>SystemConfigurator</application> identifies the
	configuration files in use and associates that footprint with a
	configuration style. It then correctly manages settings, such as hostname
	and IP address, without needing to know the name of the distribution.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	Therefore, <application>SystemImager</application> is distribution
	agnostic in nearly all areas. With few exceptions, all distribution
	specific knowledge exists within the SystemConfigurator tool, which
	supports a very large range of distributions. If you find a
	distribution that does not work with
	<application>SystemImager</application>, please file a bug report.
      </para>

      <title>System Requirements</title>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Your image server must have enough disk space to hold the images
	    to be installed on your client systems (the default directory used
            to store images is <filename>/var/lib/systemimager/images</filename>).
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    All clients that will use the same image should have the same
	    number of hard drive(s). The hard drives may be of different
	    capacities, and disks may be larger with no problem and smaller
	    within reason.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Advanced users can modify the 
	    <filename>/etc/systemimager/disks-layout.xml</filename> file
	    within an image to make adjustments, then run the 
   	    <command>si_mkautoinstallscript(8)</command> command to install
	    the same image on clients with varying disk and/or filesystem
	    configurations.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    For PXE installations, you need a compatible TFTP server
	    running on the boot server, which is usually the same machine as
	    the image/DHCP server. Debian provides such servers in the
	    <application>tftpd-hpa</application> and <application>atftpd</application>
	    packages, while Red Hat 7.0 and later include such a server in the
	    <application>tftp-server</application> package. H. Peter Anvin
	    maintains the <application>tftp-hpa</application> package, which
	    provides the required functionality.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    In addition to a compatible TFTP server, PXE network-based
	    installations may also require a PXE daemon to run on your
	    image server.  This requirement depends on the firmware used on
	    the clients and the capabilities of your DHCP server.
	    Usually a running PXE daemon is not necessary if the image server
	    uses a recent distribution, since all recent versions
	    of the DHCP daemon include PXE functionality. 
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    We strongly recommend usage of the
	    <command>si_mkbootserver(8)</command> tool, included in
	    <application>SystemImager</application>, to properly set up
	    a boot server.

	  </para>
	  <para>
	    An image is a chroot-able filesystem, stored in
	    <filename>/var/lib/systemimager/images/$NAME</filename>.

      <glossentry>
	<glossterm>override</glossterm>
	<glossdef>
	  <para>
	    Overrides can be used to manage differences from images. A typical
	    use is to customize a "vanilla" image by adding additional
	    packages, but they are commonly used to store and distribute
	    configuration files by <command>si_pushoverrides(8)</command>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Overrides are stored by default in /var/lib/systemimager/overrides/
	    (this directory can be changed in the configuration file
	    <command>/etc/systemimager.conf</command>).
	    All the files and directories defined inside an override are
	    distributed exactly as-is, which means preserving
	    <emphasis>all</emphasis> data and metadata: permissions,
	    ownership, timestamps, etc.

	<glossterm>autoinstall media</glossterm>
	<glossdef>
	  <para>
	    Media that is used to boot an autoinstall client to begin the
	    autoinstall process.  Autoinstall media can be a USB disk, a

      <glossentry>
	<glossterm>autoinstall script</glossterm>
	<glossdef>
	  <para>
	    One or more scripts associated with an image, each unique

	    The autoinstall script (also called the ".master script") is 
	    downloaded and executed by the autoinstall client, and performs
	    most of the autoinstall process.
	    Names of autoinstall scripts begin with the image name 
	    and end in .master.  For example:
