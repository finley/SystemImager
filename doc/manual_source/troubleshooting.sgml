     What is the &quot;ETHER_SLEEP&quot; variable, and when should I adjust
     it?
    </title>
    <para>
     The ETHER_SLEEP variable specifies the number of seconds that your 
     autoinstall client(s) should wait before trying to talk to the network.  
     The default is zero (0), to make installs go faster, as a timeout is not 
     normally needed.
    </para>
    <para>
     Certain networking equipment, notable switches, may refuse to pass traffic
     from a new interface that has appeared on a switch port until after a 30+
     second delay.  This delay is usually a settable option (if your switch even
     has this capability).  Whether or not it is set on your switches is vendor
     and/or site specific.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you encounter problems during an autoinstall, such as your autoinstall
     client not recieving an IP address via DHCP: a) you find that when you ask
     for a DHCP address from the command line, you get one.  b) you manually 
     configure the network interface and can then contact the imageserver; then
     you may want to change the ETHER_SLEEP variable.  
    </para>
    <para>
     Both of these symptoms can often be explained by the 30+ second timeout 
     passing prior to the manual intervention.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you decide to change the ETHER_SLEEP variable, a value of 35 has been
     found to work in most cases (ETHER_SLEEP=35).  ETHER_SLEEP can be set in
     a local.cfg file or by modifying the ./etc/init.d/rcS script in the BOEL
     source code.
    </para>
    <para>
     NOTE: The 30+ second timeout at the switch begins with the interface on
     your autoinstall client is made active (Ie: driver loaded), and is not
     necessarily tied to when the interface is configured with an IP address.

    <Para>Goran Pocian reported an instance of unacceptable

      will retrieve its contents.  As this can heavily increase network load,
      it can also cause bad performance.

	Every once in a while, someone reports some mysterious hanging or
	transfer interruption issue related to rsync.  I had a chance to
	speak with Andrew Tridgell in person to discuss these issues.
      </Para>
      <Para>
	We found two known issues that could be the source of these symptoms.
	One is a known kernel issue, and one is an rsync issue.  The kernel
	issue is supposedly resolved in 2.4.x series kernels, (SystemImager
	has not yet been "officially" tested with 2.4.x kernels) and may not
	be present in all 2.2.x series kernels (I believe).
      </Para>
      <Para>
	The rsync bug will be fixed in the rsync 2.4.7 release (to happen 
	"Real Soon Now (TM)" ).  The rsync bug is caused by excessive numbers
	of errors filling the error queue which causes a race condition.
	However, until rsync 2.4.7 has been out for some time, I will still
	recommend using v2.4.6 unless you specifically experience one of
	these issues.
      </Para>
      <Para>
	Here's a hack that seems to work for Chris Black.  Add "--bwlimit=10000" 
	right after "rsync" in each rsync command in the &lt;image&gt;.master script.

	  Change: "rsync -av --numeric-ids $IMAGESERVER::web_server_image_v1/ /sysroot/"

    <para>
      Be sure that the image server can look up the client's hostname based
      on its IP address.  The easiest way to do this is to have entry in the 
      image server's <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> file for the client
      system.

      This failure is most commonly associated with a mismatch between the
      version of SystemImager you used to create your image and the version
      of SystemImager you used to create the corresponding .master script.
    </para>
    <para>
      As of SystemImager 2.0, SystemConfigurator is used to make final
      configuration changes to an image.  SystemConfigurator is executed from
      within the image, so it must be installed within the image on the image
      server.  To insure this, SystemConfigurator must be installed on any 
      golden client before an image is pulled from it.  If you have images 
      that were pulled from golden clients that did not have 
      SystemConfigurator installed, you can install SystemConfigurator 
      directly into the image on the imagserver.

      My client completes the autoinstall process successfully, but I get an
      "Invalid Partition Table" error upon reboot, and Linux never boots.
    </title>
    <para>
      SystemImager 2.0.x and earlier didn't maintain the bootable flag in
      the partition table.  This worked fine in most cases, but in some cases
      this leads to an unbootable system.  To confirm that this is the problem,
      boot your system from rescue media, and set the bootable flag on your
      boot partition using cfdisk or another partitioning tool.  If this
      allows your system to boot, then you must upgrade SystemImager and
      regenerate your autoinstallscript(s).
      If for some reason you can't upgrade, then check the following:
    </para>

	<para>
	  Be sure that you are using the latest version of SystemImager and

	  <filename>VERSION</filename> file.
