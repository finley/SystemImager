NOTE: While those options are still valid, it is recommanded to use
new kernel cmdline parameters (si.config= ...)

See http://www.iana.org/assignments/bootp-dhcp-parameters for details on DHCP
options.  The following are special DHCP options used by SystemImager.

	=> If you're using legacy isc-dhcpd:
    option-140  ->  IMAGESERVER
    option-141  ->  LOG_SERVER_PORT
    option-142  ->  SSH_DOWNLOAD_URL
    option-143  ->  FLAMETHROWER_DIRECTORY_PORTBASE
    option-144  ->  TMPFS_STAGING

	=> If you're using new isc-kea-dhcp4:
	image-server           : code 200 -> Image server (ip-address or fqdn)
	log-server-port        : code 201 -> Log Server Port (uint-16)
	ssh-download-url       : code 202 -> SSH Download URL (string)
	flamethrower-port-base : code 203 -> Flamethrower port base (uint-16)
	tmpfs-staging          : code 204 -> tmpfs staging dir (string)

Files in the SystemImager source code that are affected by these options 
include:

    sbin/si_mkdhcpserver
	sbin/si_mkdhcpserver_legacy
    initrd_source/skel/etc/dhclient.conf
    initrd_source/skel/etc/wicked/dhcp4.xml
    initrd_source/skel/etc/dhclient-script.si-prefix
	lib/dracut/modules.d/51systemimager/systemimager-load-network-infos.sh
    doc/examples/local.cfg
    README.SystemImager_DHCP_options


NOTE:  

    These options were not in use as per IANA when they were originally
    chosen by the SystemImager dev team, but now have official
    designations for other purposes.  It is likely that most sites will
    not experience any conflict, and the current values will work just
    fine.  At some point, we will either register official numbers for
    SystemImager use or switch to using the "Reserved (Private Use)"
    range.  In either case, we will retain backwards compatibility for
    existing configurations.
