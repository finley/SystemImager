#    Purpose:
#      This file reads settings from local.cfg if required and store config in
#      cmdline.d before network is setup by dracut initqueue logic.
#      It must be run after udev is started in order to have access to filesystems
#      that are lying on lvm or software raid devices. (udev will bring to life those
#      lvm and software raid devices).
# 

# 1st check iif we have aloready done this task.
