#    Purpose:
#      This file is run by cmdline hook from dracut-cmdline service
#      This file is responsible to initialize the systemimager dracut environment.
#      It sets up systemimager work environment and also sets some values to 
#      make dracut-cmdline happy when it has finisshed processing cmdline hooks
#      dracut-cmdline hook expect root= and rootok= to be set after all scripts are run.
#      it also expects netroot to be set on old versions otherwise network is not initialized.
#      at last some cmdline.d values are also set.

# Tells bash we need bashisms (I/O redirection to subshell) by disabling stric
# posix mode.
